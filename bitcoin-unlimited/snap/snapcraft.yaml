  The Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) project seeks to provide a voice to all
  stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

  Every node operator or miner can currently choose their own blocksize limit
  by modifying their client. Bitcoin Unlimited makes the process easier by
  providing a configurable option for the accepted and generated blocksize via
  a GUI menu. Bitcoin Unlimited further provides a user-configurable failsafe
  setting allowing you to accept a block larger than your maximum accepted
  blocksize if it reaches a certain number of blocks deep in the chain.
